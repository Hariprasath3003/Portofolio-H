A real-time finger counting and gesture recognition system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It detects 0–7 fingers from the right hand through a webcam and powers HandGestureWithVoiceAssistance, enabling elderly or patients to signal needs (e.g., 1 finger → water, 2 fingers → restroom) with instant voice responses.
