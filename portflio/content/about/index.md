Hello! I'm Hari Prasath G, originally from Salem and currently based in Coimbatore.

I am a creative, punctual, and dedicated individual who values discipline, continuous learning, and quality work. I bring strong communication skills, good organizational abilities, and a detail-oriented mindset to everything I do.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Paavai Engineering College](https://paavai.edu.in/) (Batch 2020–2024).

I was also a member of the **Google Developer Student Club – PEC**, where I explored new technologies, worked on real projects, and collaborated with like-minded developers.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
